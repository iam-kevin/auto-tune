1,The pickling process was explained in detail which provides great insight and establishes a connection between you as the writer and the reader.,"How can you establish your thesis more effectively?, How do you bring all of these elements together to form a more cohesive final draft?, Would it be more effective to change the order and structure in which the paper was written?",The rubric is followed well in regards to content. One thing to note is that the professor prefers Chicago style references and citations.,not really because he just give me a very basic feedback.,0.0,because he give very short feedback.,some requirement and also hot to explore my project,I will change my formatted and also re-check my essay.,3.0,he said chicago style will be good,3.0,not a lot help,3.0,may be I will check my style one more time.,4.5,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.5
11,The readings were well incorporated into the draft and the ideas were well tied together.,"What is the thesis?, How does your mead making experience exemplify mutual attunement?, How will mutual attunement and mad scientist tie into the unfinished sections?",The draft used the fermentation project and reading to support its arguments,I know they didn't because they missed things that I think are pretty darn obvious.,-1.0,I expected more nuanced feedback and do not believe that my failings are quite so entry level,"It made me realize that, as obvious as things seem to be, they need to be more obvious. ",I will review it to see if points are clear.,1.0,No mention,1.0,No mention,3.0,"Somewhat, but I am spitefully skeptical, if my comments are any indication. ",3.5,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0
13,I liked that all the readings and how they supported your arguments was planned out and that there was a section on counterarguments,"What are some specific examples of what made you change your mind?, What impact did your fermentation project have on your viewpoints?, Are you going to explore how fermentation has an impact on societies/communities beyond the health benefits?",The draft uses the readings to support its arguments,Their questions that they wrote showed that they had an understanding of what I planned on writing in my draft.,1.0,I feel more confident about what I will write about.,I was able to get some feedback on my paper and was able to see what worked well and what didn’t. This will help me better figure out what to write about going forward.,I will try and incorporate more personal experiences and what I was feeling throughout my time fermenting. I feel that will show off my argument more and provide people a reason to trust me and my argument more.,4.0,"While they didn’t give any specific feedback on the technique, I can see that they took the time to read and understand what I wrote and would tell me if there were any problems. ",5.0,They provided me with helpful questions to answer to better my argument and essay.,5.0,I gave the rating above because they provided some helpful things to include that could make the argument even stronger.,2.5,1.0,2.5,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
39,"This draft has a clear direction, and very specific questions which will help guide you and your students throughout the unit. Try to have a few of the most important ones posted around the room so you can reference them whenever you want to bring the students to the ""overall goal"". ","What are some questions you can ask the students that are related to the topic of Ancient Rome that can guide them as they learn?, How can you help students veer away from the related misconceptions about Ancient Rome?, Why is learning about Ancient Rome important/relevant for 6th grade students in the 21st century? ","This draft is quite concise and is explicitly focused on the topic of Ancient Rome. The standards are clearly tied to the strands/concepts that are to be taught, and there is specificity to what you would like the students to understand by the end of the unit. Many of the concepts and the particular PO's listed should also be under the ""overarching understanding"" section, as these are the frames of knowledge you would like the students to take with them at the end of the unit. Also, my understanding of the essential questions is as follows: the overarching questions are those that are broad, ""philosophical"" questions that you can ask of this unit, as well as other similar units (e.g. why is it important to study ancient civilizations?, what can we gain from studying ancient civilizations?). The topical essential questions are slightly more specific to your unit (e.g. what elements of Ancient Roman culture have we carried into modern civilization?, how can we look to Ancient Roman leaders and examine their successes?). Hope this helps!",Because they reviewer challenged me to consider how the topic is relevant to the lives of my students today.,0.0,I don't know,It was helpful becasue it is challenging me to veer away from common misconceptions about ancient Rome.,I am going to add a component that asks students themselves to consider how the topic of ancient Rome is relevant to their lives in modern day.

40,I love the general premise of the draft. Sci-fi and Fantasy are among my favorite dramas. They are versatile and have many modes of expression for students to reflect and grow through them.,"How can you work in the differences of reflection between sci-fi and fantasy? Sci-fi is the outward look of humanity upon the universe while fantasy is the inward exploration of humanity. , How are you exploring the differences between the two genres? , What literature will you use and how in-depth will you go?",The draft builds upon standards to continue a rigorous and reflective unit. The unit itself is built around exploring how sci-fi and fantasy are tools of reflection on humanity. This builds on the standards and creates an engaging unit.,They understood the intentions by asking for even stronger details of the depth.,1.0,The assessor clearly understood and was interested in providing quality feedback.,It offered insightful suggestions into improving my assignment.,"I will include materials, and better reach the necessary depth for a strong unit plan.",5.0,Only mentioned a shortage of details.,5.0,Offered opinions on how to improve the depth.,5.0,Asked questions regarding specific content usage.,5.0,3.0,3.5,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0
44,I liked the lesson plan! I thought it was very interesting and engaging for the students to learn about the migration of the Spanish through the use of a play I think that will lend itself to a very interesting class and student-led learning.,"How will students memorize the play?, What is the purpose of the video in relation to the greater lesson?, How will the next unit expand on this lesson?","They use standards, they have plenty of detail and provide a clear reason for why they are doing this lesson.

 IC.IM.1. Participate in conversations on familiar topics by using a series of sentences and a few connecting words.
IL.IH.1. Understand the main idea and a few details in messages, presentations, and overheard conversations (even when something unexpected is expressed) on a variety of topics related to everyday life, personal interests, and studies.
IR.IH.2. Sometimes follow stories and descriptions about events and experiences in various time frames.

50,"I really like some of the topical understandings, particularly""what is power to young adults"" which is an excellent and engaging question with related texts provided.","Is this geared more toward the overall goal of a year than a single unit?, Can the language be more succinct?, Is the formatting consistent across the boxes; font, bullet points, and margins?",The draft provides multiple examples of state standards,Yes I believe they did understand what I was assessing; their feedback was good and authentic.,1.0,They chose a few questions they really enjoyed that helped me to focus my topic rather than grasp at many.,This assessment was helpful as it asked to narrow down some of these major topics. I had originally made these question for a unit closer but I think I made it too broad.,I will choose one or two relevant essential questions to my students so I can make my topical questions even better. I will cut out unnecessary parts and break apart other sections over the course of the year.,5.0,They noticed small font differences that I needed to change. They also noticed opportunities for more conciseness rather than unnecessary elaboration.,3.0,"They observed that there were areas that needed less words and more succinctness. This was helpful in making the strength better, not just the length. ",3.0,"They told me to make it shorter but stronger, chose a few questions, and be more specific with particular areas. I wish their feedback had been more focused but it was still effective. ",4.0,2.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0
56,I like the Overarching Essential Question. It is something that can easily be connected to the students personal lives.,"In your skills, how can you either clarify or create a skill (objective) that can connect to the later assessment? I am assuming from your standards that your assessment piece is going to be some sort of writing assignment. If you make your objectives more clear you will be able to easily connect the three as you get there. , You mention in your skill that students will be able to identify the author's use for figurative language, but in your knowledge section you mention students will know figurative language. 

How can you connect this gap that could be missing in you students knowledge, within the Skills section?, If you are going to have students completing a writing portion there are some grammar or language standards you may want to consider for this unit. They can be found L.6 portion. 
I guess in question form, are you considering adding a grammar component to this lesson?",All parts of the assignment were accounted for. There is enough detail to see a good overview of what is going to being taught throughout the unit. The objectives seem to line up well with the Standards.,"The assessor focused on very technical elements of my draft, but not the overall quality of the unit. They had a general grasp of my intentions, but not the whole picture. ",0.0,The assessor didn't give any feedback that was amazing or negative. I feel like the reviewer just captured a few minor errors that could have been caught during my improvement of the draft.,"This assessment helped me see what standards, skills, and knowledge I could add to my unit. It also helped me identify any gaps between certain standards, skills, and knowledge. ",I will make sure to close gaps between knowledge and skills. I will also look into adding some supplemental grammar into my unit.,4.0,The reviewer found some minor errors with my standards.,3.0,The reviewer was able to identify some structural issues like gaps between understanding and a few skills/knowledge issues.,3.0,My peer did not add a lot of suggestions that would improve the substance of my work. My peer only discussed adding grammar and language standards to my unit.,5.0,4.5,5.0,4.0,2.5,4.5,4.5
62,I liked the fact that the teacher provided detailed information and also the knowledge that students need to succeed in class are well written and stated.,"Do students need to take someone's point of view? For example; from the slaves, or people from the south., how long will this unit take place? 
, how can you make the skills more specific?",I think that this draft follows the requirement of the assignment by having all the information needed for students to succeed.,"I think the assessor was a bit vague and broad. Im not sure if they really understood what they were intending with my draft. At the same time, my draft was also very simple and to-the-point so I understand how the feedback could've been the same.",0.0,"Like I mentioned, I think the feedback was very vague and simple. I didn't get too many new points to improve my unit. However, it was very positive and it reinforced a lot of concepts that I felt very positive about.","Thanks to the assessment, I will now add a section of questions that includes different perspectives from multiple group POVs.",I will add the different perspectives section to my essential questions.,2.0,"Not very, none of them were mentioned in the feedback.",2.0,Not very--like the errors--they did not mention them in my feedback.,3.0,"They were decently good, I did get a suggestion that I was intrigued by and wouldn't have thought about otherwise.",3.5,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.5
66,Their is a clear connection between the knoweldge​ students will know after this unit and the skills students will be able to demonstrate at the end of the unit as well.,"Maybe you can make a direct appeal to ethos with your questions and ask even more general questions about why people attend plays and why ""drama"" is so infatuating and addicting sometimes, and the way it sells? , Perhaps you can ask a topical questions more directly expressing extreme love and compassion? Maybe you can say ""how to use soliloquys ​to make someone fall in love with you? Or something along thise​ lines. , What about the language in Romeo and Juliet? (Be specific, Shakespeearian or Elizbethian) It's inaccesible?​ Etc. ","The overarching and topical essential questions follow the appropriate framework. The overaching essential questions focus on elements of drama, theatre a​nd literary elements too. The topical questions are specifically focused on Romeo and Juliet and how they relate to soliloquys ​and monologues. ",The assessor understood because it was clear they provided feedback that helped progress my plans.,1.0,"They didn't tear it apart like I was expecting, so I felt like this unit might not be as bad as it went this year",This was helpful because it added some content that I didn't even really think about and gave me some ideas to strengthen some of my questions.  The feedback I received will help me create a stronger unit because there will be more elements of real life mixed in,I will add some depth to my essential questions,3.0,I did not see any typos nor were they mentioned,4.0,They gave some strong ideas for essential questions,3.0,They took my work and looked at it on a deeper level and strengthened some of my ideas.,4.5,3.0,4.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,4.0
68,"I enjoyed the idea of writing a children's book. Asking students to create a story for a younger audience using elements like plot and a theme of ""choices"" really proves if a students understands the concepts taught in the unit. If a student can teach something well, they know it. The children's book is an extension of that idea. Through the book, students are ""teaching"" plot, main idea, supporting details, and the idea of ""choice"" and important decisions. ","I see that you have characterization worksheets listed for a summative assessment. Have you thought about, once students start working on their books, having the students use a characterization sheet for their own characters?, How are you going to prime students to begin thinking like a parent? Are you going to look at children's books prior to the task? How will students grasp the idea of what they should be creating ""as a parent""?, How can you utilize the pictures and illustrations students put in their books as another way for you to see and conceptualize their understanding?",The draft follow the requirements of the assignments by including an engaging real-world application of the skills being developed in the unit. The task is formatted to gauge the multiple understandings of the students related to all of the skills and knowledge they will develop over the course of the unit. Creating a children's book is a real-world task that adults do. Engaging a younger audience is a task that many adults face. The draft also expresses the various summative and formative assessments that Red will use to gauge student understanding.,It suggested many improvements.,1.0,It suggested many improvements.,It suggested many improvements.,I will have students connect all the standards explicitly to their own book. It will deepen understanding and hopefully show more mastery.,3.0,This is irrelevant.,5.0,It suggested many improvements.,5.0,It suggested many improvements.,5.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,1.0,1.0,4.0
77,I think this is to the point and easy to understand.  Students will have a clear picture of what they're doing and why they're doing it.,"Did you forget to include other evidence?  I think this section includes formative assessments throughout the unit that is not accounted for in the final product., What will student slideshows contain, exactly?, How will you check for understanding throughout the unit to be sure students can produce this final product?",The GRASPS is perfect for the age group and is well assigned.  I think this stage of the draft follows the planning in Stage 1 appropriately.,not sure that i can,0.0,I have too many other demands on my time to decide if i feel one way or another emotionally about what they said.,"I hadn't thought about writing out specific expectations for the slideshows and what should be on them, i was trying to allow for student creativity, but I see that they should also have parameters to follow for them to develop that assignment.",I will add additional detail and another set of expectations for students,3.0,"no errors only refinement, don't like the word error",3.0,I highly appreciate another set of eyes on my work and helping me to move forward on developing my materials,3.0,"it was helpful to receive affirmation on decisions i've made on what students will cover, that additonal set of eyes is invaluable",4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
86,"I liked how students will be able to use their own language to develop a sense of the word ""hero.""","How is this going to stretch students' abilities? , What is the real-world application, beyond creating a self-definition of the word ""hero""?, How are you making sure your instructions are clear and precise? (Some grammar errors between you and your)",The draft has a clear direction that the students should be able to run with.,They didn't really understand it since their focus was on real world application rather than language development in ESL students which is an inherent real world application.,0.0,"It felt like hasty ""have to give feedback"" feedback. ",The assessment did not give much way into how to develop the lesson more. It did clarify a few errors I had.,I will fix my grammar errors.,2.0,They caught grammar errors and nothing else.,2.0,No suggestions given.,2.0,None were given.,5.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0
93,"The connection to real world issues such as poverty by exploring literature as a combination of multiple sources of media is an excellent idea. Students are compelled to think about ways that their research skills may be applied to bring social change within their own community, and this makes the project very relevant to the everyday conditions and realities of the community around them. ","Would students simply submit all of their materials to you (infographic charts, essays, etc.) or would they orally present these to you? If they are to orally present to you, which other standards would this assignment fulfill?, Can you include a mini-rubric to be more specific about the performance level descriptors for each proficiency level for the skills being evaluated?, How would you be able to differentiate and offer the students more agency in choosing their product?",The GRASPS performance task is clearly outlined and appropriately formulated for the grade level.,"The assessor gave me specific feedback in the ""what did you like"" portion, which makes me feel like they clearly understood my intentions with this draft. ",1.0,"It was nice what they told me I did well. Also, their questions were very specific, which makes me think that there are only minor things that have to be fixed with the draft. ","This assessment was helpful because it had me think about logistical things (rubric, how they will submit information). This helps me refine my performance assessment in order to have a clear idea about what I will do. ","I incorporated the specific feedback. For example, I included a portion that outlines that the audience is myself and other students in the class. In addition, I added Speaking and Listening standards to the performance assessment because they will be working on those skills when they present. Finally, I included information about developing the rubric at a later date. ",3.0,They helped me see that there were a few small pieces missing that I still had to include.,4.0,They helped me see that there were a few small pieces missing that I still had to include.,3.0,They didn't suggest too many things that had to be fixed as it related to the substance of my work.,5.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0
94,I like the assignment to encourage students on the merits of activism.,"Will students receive a list of activist movements they can pursue? That way you can prime their thinking with a list of various roles?, Will there be roles on the city council (moderator, admin, judge, etc) for students so they can fulfill different roles?, What other evidence can we use for mastery besides the three-minute speech and summary? Could there be another activity or quiz related to civics that students can do to learn about the various nuances of public speaking and public work? ",The assignment fulfills the requirements of the assignment by providing a differentiated and outlined goal for the students who will be doing a GRASP task.,They understood the requirements for GRASP,0.0,This way of giving feedback is not that useful.,It provide different ideas of how to assess mastery.,Small minor changes in the details regarding assessing their knowledge.,2.0,They were not looking for grammatical errors.,3.0,They provide a good idea of jobs within the city council.,3.0,They gave some useful feedback.,4.0,3.5,4.5,3.5,1.0,2.5,4.5
101,"You have developed a firm grasp on what skills and standards you would like your students to learn from throughout this unit. You address them quite specifically and purposefully with your performance task, as well as with the essential questions you have asked. ","Will you allow them to present their letters to a group or to the whole class, so they can compare their ideas and interpretations of the most important sections in the text with one another?, How will the students relate their personal experiences to those of the characters within the novel? If you really want them to connect with the themes in the story, allow them to find experiences/feelings they have and tie them to the events/themes within the novel. , How will the change you make to the Performance task (since you said that it had changed after another peer's feedback) still address the standards that you want to cover? Will it remain as personal and real-world as the letter you initially wanted them to create?","The specific requirements of the performance task aligns quite well with the standards you are looking to address, and they go along with many of the overarching understandings you have listed. I quite like how personal the product is as the themes are dealing with ideas such as self-construction, relationships to others, and identity influencing choices. ","Yes, I could tell that the assessor understood what I was intending with my draft.",1.0,Because they were incredibly positive with their comments and then gave good questions to allow for an easy revision.,"This assessment was helpful because it allowed me to think about ways to enhance this assignment, including the idea that I should have them write to people in their class or in the other seventh grade and then perhaps allow for a response. I think that it is important that the students are able to relate their experiences to the characters that they are reading in the book and this is a great way to make sure that that happens.",I will make changes to incorporate more of a dialogue to get the students to think about the characters and the roles they play.,4.0,My peer was great at catching ways to enhance my draft!,3.0,The structure was already provided to me by our professor.,4.0,They were incredibly helpful in asking good questions that will allow me to better my work.,5.0,5.0,4.5,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0
116,"The author provided many opportunities to guide themselves as they create the unit, especially in the form of objectives, guiding questions, engagement strategies, graphic organizers, lesson ideas, etc. ","Who are you writing THIS unit plan for? It appears that this is very technical, and loaded with many high-level and ""Teacher's College"" ideals. Remember, this assignment is meant to guide YOU as you create the unit plan, not to appease any other person's idea of a what a unit plan should be. Think about writing ideas (especially in the hook, experience and explore, and organize sections) that will be more functional for you. , How will you engage students in the idea of letter writing, besides in creating active change in their community? Some students may be put-off by the idea if they don't see their real world (social media & teenage life) relevancy. , How will you incorporate creativity more into this project? Besides the students picking their own topics, how will you engage their creative sides? Will you have them create corresponding art pieces, media samples, dioramas, present it to their peers and community, etc.?","The draft has all of the necessary areas of Stage 3 completed, with objectives and guiding questions provided frequently throughout. The assignment appears to have a concrete goal (to prove to students that letter-writing is effective, worthwhile, and an essential skill in a variety of occasions).

Beginning, after winter break, or towards the end?, What information would be necessary in terms of pre-teaching so students could start to understand the concept of imperialism?, Would you be able to implement an activity of some sort?

129,"I love the high rigor of the assignment, but yet it is broken down into achievable non-intimidating chunks.","Are students reading full unabridged versions of the stories?  If so, how did you prepare them for the experience., What is the differentiation like for students that would struggle with the entire unit?, I really don't have a third question, there is wonderful rigor in having students consider both sides of the story and even different versions like if the families were actually friends.",The draft is highly detailed in walking the students through the assignment and uses user friendly comparisons to assist the students in connecting with expectations.,"I think that a main part of my planning was based on rigor, so this assessor really saw my vision for the unit.

134,I really like how detail oriented Conner is.  He really has everything carefully planned out and integrates many different concepts into this lesson plan and I think that will be beneficial for his students.  He does a great job of drafting this unit for the needs of his students as well.,"Do you have a calendar?  She mentioned that you needed to have a calendar (like the example in the book) , Are your social issues going to focus primarily on things relevant to their lives or on things that are experienced throughout the entire world?

Would presentations be the best way or would a Gallery Walk be beneficial? ",The draft does a really good job of outlining what is needed in this assignment.  I think each stage is carefully thought out and follows the assignment very well.

142,Philosophical chairs to hook the students' engagement and create a deeper understanding of the text from different perspectives.,"How will you differentiate or assist students with lower engagement ability to participate in the philosophical chairs?, How will you assess the philosophical chair exercise?, What will you provide students that miss or do not participate in any aspect of the unit plan?",In stage III there is ample evidence that the teacher has provided sufficient information on the learning plan.  Each aspect of level III is focused and well organized on grade level engagement and student opportunity for growth and understanding.  Each step of level III offers support from the teacher and scaffolds the lesson from most basic understanding to more complex thinking.,I can tell that the assessor understood what I was intending with my draft based off of what they focused on in regards to my draft.,1.0,The assessor helped me see some things I missed in my planning and that will help my students in the future.,This assessment allowed me to see where some of the gaps were in my thinking and planning.

160,I liked the diversity of outputs that the draft contained within the acquisition section. It really helps students access content from multiple learning avenues which appeals to all learners rather than just a few. This draft also implements a high sense of rigor within the unit where students are creating and comparing/contrasting throughout the unit which incorporates DOK levels 3 and 4.,"What support will you give your students to make the connections from microscopic (cells) to macroscopic (universe) in order for them to successfully accomplish your learning goals at the end of the unit?, What have you done previously to help your students with abstract thinking challenges?

161,"I love the way that the essential questions encapsulate the major topics and still keep it relevant to content.

I am still pretty confused about the difference between overarching and topical essential questions. The overarching essential questions are important, thought-provoking and do not have just one right answer. The topical questions are not recall questions; however, they do have a right and wrong answer to them. My understanding is that essential questions should be big ideas that we (including students) can explore.
All questions and understandings are aligned to the standards. The skills section is missing content, but I imagine the author may have been confused about what to place in that category.",They used specific quotes from my document and analyzed specific portions of it rather than generalize.,0.0,Mostly because I knew I left portions out so I didn't really need feedback or comments on my missing content.,It provided me with clarification on specific portions of stage 1 that I had not considered before.,1) I will finish it because I wasn't able to accomplish the whole assignment prior to submitting it to beagle. 2)I will reevaluate some of my sections and move some of my writing around to better fit our rubric.,3.0,They didn't really comment on grammatical errors.,4.0,They looked at content within my different sections and suggested moving some of my pieces to different sections to better fit the structure of the unit.,3.0,They saw that I left a whole section blank and commented on it.,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,1.0,4.0,3.5
178,I really like the sequence to the unit. It all looks like it will flow well from topic to topic!,"How can you push students to think about their belief on the origin, expansion, and  scale of the universe? You have a really cool opportunity to bring in a variety of viewpoints just with religion alone. , Under Acquisition (students will be able to...), can the first four skills be revised to align more with the content? For example, the first skill makes it sound like the skill being practiced is making a model. I think making the model would be part of stage 2 where you have criteria or evidence of understanding. , Where is the U1 standard appearing in Stage 1 (maybe I missed it!)?","The unit's focus is stated clearly and provides specific information on how the material will be sequenced.
I'm not sure if I am misunderstanding the difference between the overarching and topical essential questions, but I believe they both should be open-ended, big ideas that we can ponder because there is not absolute correct answer. The overarching questions are doing this, but I think the topical questions are not. For the topical questions, we can answer all with a correct and incorrect response. 
Everything is aligned to the standards is the unit, but I feel like U1 is being left out. I don't see evidence of how students will actively revise theories based on new evidence discovered. ",The assessor read through the standard in depth to ensure that stage 1 included all aspects. The assessor also gave feedback on multiple areas of stage 1.,1.0,The questions are framed constructively and the assessor took the time to look at my document in depth.,This feedback was very helpful! It brought light to the fact that I may have missed the mark with U1 and mentions the opportunity to incorporate diagnostic assessing at the start to the unit to get a base on where students are and what ideas they are bringing with them on the topic.,"I will investigate if I am in fact covering U1. I will not integrate religion into this lesson, I think it is best to keep church and state separate.

It also relates the objectives and target skills to standards.,I don't feel they fully understood my skills and knowledge sections because if I condense them anymore I don't feel someone would be able to take my paper as is and know exactly what their students should be able to do at the end of the unit,-1.0,"I guess I'm defensive and confused, refer to above answer of the previous question.",It made me really happy about my cover page because I worked really hard on it.,I will check for spelling and grammar errors because that's like writing 101,3.0,"They didn't specifically point out any spelling errors which would have been helpful, but they mentioned that I should check so maybe I missed something.",4.0,They didn't really mention anything about structure aside from complimenting my cover page,2.0,"I don't feel I need to make anything more concise, I felt I made it as concise as I could without losing substance/full ideas.",4.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.5,4.5,2.5

201,I love how creative it is!,"Rather than saying ""something will be done,"" could you try to do it and include a rough draft here? That might help you think through this if you're actually going to do it :), How will you ensure that students come out of this awesome activity aware of what exactly they learned? I.e. how will you make the standard explicit without stripping the fun?, This is a great way to engage the artistic kids, but how will you cater to the classic-students too, who like multiple choice tests and straight forward assignments? Perhaps with the roles? Those are a great idea! ","THIS IS AWESOME! I read through the first four lines and was like ""I'm in, where do I sign up, but how the heck does this connect to content?""

202,I really enjoyed the idea of this lesson and how this part of the lesson is a problem based learning exercise. Students will have to fully understand equations and inequalities to be able to solve the Adidas scenario.,"Where did the Adidas idea come from? , How will students show they have mastered the concept? , What kind of extension will there be?
